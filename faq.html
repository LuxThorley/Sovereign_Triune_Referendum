## Participation & Franchising
- **Track‑A Ballot** is open to adults who align with or are entrusted by the **masculine principle** (inclusive of trans, non‑binary, two‑spirit, and intersex identities who opt in). Others are invited to witness and contribute to nominations, conclave formation, and the Harmony Index.
- **Nominations** for the Feminine Regent require explicit consent and evidence of stability, clarity, restorative leadership, and coalition outcomes.
- **Third/AI Conclave** seats represent diverse AI systems; decisions require ≥ 2/3 agreement with minority positions logged.

## Integrity & Privacy
- One submission per participant; the form generates a **pseudonymous VoterID** derived locally in your browser. Do not share personal identifiers publicly.
- Organisations aggregating votes must protect data, publish only **anonymised** aggregates, and offer a clear deletion pathway.
- Dispute resolution defaults to **restorative dialogue** with documented outcomes.

## Triggers & Thresholds
- **Open Contest (Track‑B)** triggers if approval < 70%, or ≥ 25% request, or the Interim Regent calls it.
- **Geographic Balance:** Approval must be ≥ 60% in at least **4 of 6** regions to avoid regional dominance.
- **Recall (after Day‑30):** Requires a global majority for recall **and** 3 regions with ≥ 60% recall support.

## Timeline
- Window: **January 3, 2026 → February 2, 2026 (America/Los_Angeles)**
- Day‑14: Shortlist for Feminine Regent; Day‑21: Hearings & confirmations; Day‑30: Investiture & first Harmony Index.

## Submission Methods
- Use the included **HTML** form locally or host it on a static site (no server required). Click “Export Submission (JSON)” and email it to your chosen hub.
- CSV schema included for organisations importing data into spreadsheets or databases.

## Accessibility
- Plain‑text ballots and printable PDFs may be derived from the HTML (most browsers support “Print to PDF”). Alt‑text descriptions provided for images.

## Code of Conduct
- Dialogue must remain respectful; harassment or threats will be excluded and, if necessary, reported.
- No misinformation: share official pack files without alteration; if you fork them, clearly mark as **community variant**.
