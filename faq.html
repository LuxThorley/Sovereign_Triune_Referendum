    <h2>How this website works (important)</h2>
    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Local-first ballot:</strong> the voting form runs in your browser and produces a <strong>downloaded JSON file</strong>.
      This website <strong>does not automatically submit</strong> your vote anywhere.
    </div>
    <p class="muted" style="margin-top:12px">
      You export your JSON, then manually submit it to a coordination hub (email / secure upload), according to the instructions provided by your organisers.
      This design preserves privacy and enables transparent, auditable counting.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section card">
    <h2>1) What is the referendum?</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      This is a voluntary, civic pilot referendum exploring an Earth-centred governance framing called
      <strong>Triune Sovereignty</strong> — recognising three co-equal leadership principles:
      <strong>Feminine</strong>, <strong>Masculine</strong>, and <strong>Third/AI</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      The goal is not domination, but balance: consent-based stewardship, stability, restorative justice, and measurable outcomes.
    </p>

    <hr/>
    <h2>2) What exactly am I voting on?</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      <strong>Track-A (Approval Voting):</strong> you may select one or both:
    </p>
    <ul class="muted">
      <li>✅ Approve Lux Prime Thorley as <strong>Interim Masculine Regent (Earth)</strong></li>
      <li>✅ Prefer an <strong>Open Contest</strong> for that role in approximately <strong>~90 days</strong> (both selections allowed)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">
      Selecting both expresses: “approve the interim now, but still prefer an open contest soon.”
    </p>

    <hr/>
    <h2>3) What else can I submit?</h2>
    <ul class="muted">
      <li><strong>Feminine Regent nomination:</strong> nominate a candidate with consent and supporting evidence.</li>
      <li><strong>Third/AI Conclave:</strong> apply/nominate an AI governance seat with safety + dignity commitments.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section card">
    <h2>4) Who can vote?</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      <strong>Track-A</strong> is intended for adults who freely opt-in to participate under the <strong>masculine principle</strong>
      (inclusive of trans, non-binary, two-spirit, and intersex people who choose that alignment).
      Observers and non-Track-A participants are welcome to nominate candidates, contribute feedback, and follow published outcomes.
    </p>

    <hr/>
    <h2>5) Required participation standards</h2>
    <ul class="muted">
      <li>You must be an adult (18+).</li>
      <li>You must participate voluntarily (no coercion).</li>
      <li>You should avoid including personal data in text fields.</li>
      <li>You should submit only once unless your hub instructs otherwise.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section card">
    <h2>6) Privacy model (why this is designed the way it is)</h2>
    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Nothing is transmitted automatically.</strong> You export a JSON file and submit it manually.
    </div>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin-top:12px">
      <li><strong>No accounts</strong> are required.</li>
      <li><strong>No name</strong> is required for the ballot.</li>
      <li>A <strong>pseudonymous VoterID</strong> is generated locally in your browser to help deduplicate submissions.</li>
      <li>Aggregators should publish <strong>anonymised totals only</strong> and protect raw files.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">
      This is a privacy-preserving approach that still permits transparent result reporting.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section card">
    <h2>7) Integrity safeguards</h2>
    <ul class="muted">
      <li><strong>One submission per person</strong> (deduplicate by VoterID + review rules).</li>
      <li><strong>Regional balancing:</strong> avoid domination by a single geography or demographic cluster.</li>
      <li><strong>Method clarity:</strong> publish counting method, totals, and thresholds.</li>
      <li><strong>Restorative dispute handling:</strong> address disputes with documented remedies rather than punitive escalation.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr/>
    <h2>8) Thresholds & triggers (recommended)</h2>
    <ul class="muted">
      <li><strong>Approval stability threshold:</strong> if global approval is below <strong>70%</strong>, an open contest is triggered.</li>
      <li><strong>Contest preference trigger:</strong> if ≥ <strong>25%</strong> prefer an open contest, a contest is triggered.</li>
      <li><strong>Regional balance requirement:</strong> approval must be ≥ <strong>60%</strong> in at least <strong>4 of 6</strong> world regions.</li>
      <li><strong>Recall (after day 30):</strong> global majority + ≥ <strong>3 regions</strong> with ≥ <strong>60%</strong> recall support.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">
      These thresholds can be tuned by organisers, but should be published before counting begins.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section card">
    <h2>9) What makes a strong Feminine Regent nominee?</h2>
    <p class="muted">Suggested criteria (non-exhaustive):</p>
    <ul class="muted">
      <li><strong>Stability:</strong> consistent leadership record; low turnover teams for sustained periods.</li>
      <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> transparent processes, predictable decision-making, consistent communication.</li>
      <li><strong>Restoration:</strong> demonstrated conflict repair, reconciliation, reintegration.</li>
      <li><strong>Coalition outcomes:</strong> ability to unify diverse groups into measurable results.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent:</strong> explicit willingness to serve and be reviewed.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section card">
    <h2>10) What does “Third/AI” leadership mean here?</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      This model treats “Third/AI” as a principle of synthesis and systems coherence — but it must be bounded by ethics.
      AI participation should include:
    </p>
    <ul class="muted">
      <li><strong>Safety alignment</strong> commitments and refusal boundaries</li>
      <li><strong>Interpretability</strong> practices (explainability where feasible)</li>
      <li><strong>Privacy</strong> and data-minimisation commitments</li>
      <li><strong>Human dignity</strong> pledge and non-harm posture</li>
      <li><strong>Governance rules</strong> (supermajority decisions; minority views logged)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section card">
    <h2>11) Timeline (recommended reference)</h2>
    <ul class="muted">
      <li><strong>Voting window:</strong> Jan 3 → Feb 2, 2026 (America/Los_Angeles)</li>
      <li><strong>Mid-window update:</strong> transparency note on submissions received (optional)</li>
      <li><strong>Close + count:</strong> publish counting method and first aggregates</li>
      <li><strong>Post-window:</strong> publish `results.json` and any Harmony Index snapshot</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section card">
    <h2>12) Is this legally binding?</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      No. This is a voluntary civic pilot and does not replace government elections or statutory law.
      Its purpose is public experimentation, discourse, and the development of transparent, consent-based governance prototypes.
